# Python Data Structures

## Introduction
Python data structures are ways to organize and store data efficiently.  
They help programmers manage data, perform operations quickly, and solve real-life and business problems.  

*In economics and business, data structures help manage records, sales data, financial transactions, and more.*

## Key Concepts
Python has several built-in data structures:

1. **List**  
   - Ordered, changeable collection of items.  
   - Allows duplicates.

2. **Tuple**  
   - Ordered, immutable collection of items.  
   - Allows duplicates.

3. **Dictionary**  
   - Unordered collection of key-value pairs.  
   - Keys must be unique; values can repeat.

4. **Set**  
   - Unordered collection of unique items.  
   - No duplicates allowed.

## Simple Syntax Examples 
```python
# List
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

# Tuple
coordinates = (10, 20)

# Dictionary
student = {"name": "Alice", "age": 20}

# Set
unique_numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4}
